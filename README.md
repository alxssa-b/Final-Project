# README - CS50 Final Project
## Basic General Ledger API

The aim of this project is to create a miniature (and highly simplistic) accounting web app that allows for posting entries, generating balance sheets, and viewing income statemnets. TBH, I'm still not sure what all I'm doing here. I'd like to have the following functionalities:

1. View the Chart of Accounts (standard CoA by default)
2. Post a financial transaction entry
3. Generate balance sheet
4. Generate income statement report (selecting start/end date)

A few additional things that would be nice:
- Differentiate AJEs from regular JEs, link
- Customize chart of accounts

Let's see how this goes! I'm very excited. I'll have to add a lot here later though. 

Will require use of sqlite3.
